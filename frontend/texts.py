##### OneHabit privacy disclaimer

hey there, welcome. just a couple things before we get started.<br><br>
**ai disclaimer**  
you'll be working with "Coach", your ai habit coach. Coach is rad, but remember, it's still ai so it'll make mistakes.  Coach runs on openai's gpt 3.5-turbo - you can read openai's api privacy policy here: [https://openai.com/security](https://openai.com/security).<br><br>
**data disclaimer**  
figuring out why a habit matters to you or why it's tricky to stick to it might mean sharing stuff with Coach close to the heart. all this stays locked up tight in the app that only the developer has access - strictly to improve OneHabit. and hey, just to be crystal clear, <u>your data will *never* be shared or sold, period.</u><br><br>
if you have beef with Coach or the dev, or even better, if you have suggestions/experience issues, would be sick if you could use the feedback form on your dashboard (available after you work through the intro).<br><br>
cool?<br><br>
"""

PHILOSOPHY_TEXT = """
##### OneHabit philosophy
1) humbling oneself to incremental improvement. choosing insultingly small habit goals
to emphasize consistency over ego-driven temporary motivation.
2) keeping promises to oneself and being honest with oneself when one fails. building a
trusting relationship with oneself is a sacred practice and meta-skill.
3) understanding and anticipating ways one is inclined to betray themselves helps one
be metaconscious to avoid making the same mistakes.
4) understanding one's habit as a broader noble aim and not simply a rote task. recognizing
the broader implications/greater importance of incremental improvement on your local landscape.
"""

COACH_INTRO_TEXT = """
##### introduction to Coach
---
meet Coach, your ai habit guide. Coach's job is to help you:
* identify the one habit that you feel will maximize your growth
* build awareness of what's holding you from keeping your promises to yourself
* feel encouraged in the ways you best respond to
* stay on track with manageable consistency
* develop a strong foundation for your _why_ - why your habit should be seen as a noble aim and not simply some rote task
---
but first, you'll need to choose a personality style for Coach. don't worry, you can change this later in settings.

HABIT_INTRO_TEXT = """
##### considerations for your OneHabit
---
before you discuss with Coach, here are some ideas for what makes a great habit:

* *keystone habit*: these naturally create a cascade of positive changes like a domino effect. for instance, regular exercise is often a keystone habit that leads to better eating habits, improved mood, and greater productivity.

* *alignment with values*: the most impactful habits are those that align with your core or aspirational values. when a habit resonates with what's truly important to you, it's not just a task - it becomes a meaningful part of your life.

* *sustainability*: start with small, achievable goals to avoid burnout. it's about building a habit that you can maintain in the long run, not just a fleeting effort.

* *context independence*: define the habit flexibly enough to be able to perform it in any environment (e.g., while away on vacation).

think of your habit as a seed. with the right nurturing - understanding its importance, aligning it with your values, and setting realistic goals - it can grow into a powerful force for positive change in your life.
