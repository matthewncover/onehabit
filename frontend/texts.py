##### OneHabit privacy disclaimer
---
hey there, welcome. just a couple things before we get started.<br><br>
**ai disclaimer**  
you'll be working with "Coach", your ai habit coach. Coach is rad, but remember, it's still ai so it'll make mistakes.  Coach runs on openai's gpt 3.5-turbo - you can read openai's api privacy policy here: [https://openai.com/security](https://openai.com/security).<br><br>
**data disclaimer**  
figuring out why a habit matters to you or why it's tricky to stick to it might mean sharing stuff with Coach close to the heart. all this stays locked up tight in the app that only the developer has access - strictly to improve OneHabit. and hey, just to be crystal clear, <u>your data will *never* be shared or sold, period.</u><br><br>
if you have beef with Coach or the dev, or even better, if you have suggestions/experience issues, would be sick if you could use the feedback form on your dashboard (available after you work through the intro).<br><br>
cool?<br><br>
